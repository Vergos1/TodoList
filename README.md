3. [Code Structure](#code-structure)

## 1. Installation and Launch

To launch the Todolist application, follow the steps below:

- Download all application files, including the HTML file (`index.html`), CSS file (`style.css`), and JavaScript file (`index.js`).
- Make sure you have a compatible browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and other modern browsers are recommended).
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser. This will launch Todolist.

## 2. Functionality Description

Todolist is a simple task list management application with the following key features:

- **Adding a Task:** Enter the name of the task in the text box and press "Enter" or the "Add" button. The task will be added to the list.

- **Deleting a Task:** To delete a task, click the delete button (trash can icon) next to the task. The task will be removed from the list.

- **Deleting All Tasks:** Click the "Delete All" button to delete all tasks from the list.

- **Task Tabs:** There are "Tasks" and "Tasks Done" tabs at the top of the app. The "Tasks" tab shows the current tasks, and the "Tasks Done" tab shows the completed tasks. Switch between tabs to see different task lists.

## 3. Code Structure

The Todolist app code is divided into three main parts: HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`style.css`), and JavaScript (`index.js`). Here is a brief description of each part:

- **HTML (`index.html`):** This file contains the structure of the web page, including a text box for entering tasks, "Add" and "Delete All" buttons, and a container for displaying the task list.

- **CSS (`style.css`):** This file contains the styling of web page elements to make the application attractive and user-friendly. It includes styles for the text input box, buttons, and tasks.

- **JavaScript (`index.js`):** This file contains the application logic, including event handling, adding and removing tasks, storing tasks in the browser's local storage, switching between tabs, and dynamically updating the interface.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with the JavaScript code (`index.js`) as it contains key application logic.

The Todolist application documentation provides an overview of the application and its functionality. We hope this information helps you understand how to use and customize Todolist for your needs.
